I am a student working at the Hive Helsinki campus which is a part of the 42 network. 
I am studying C and C++ while also exploring other things through personal projects.
I aspire to be a game developer, and I am learning about the topic, through personal projects such as game modding, exploring tools like unreal and unity, as well as participating in things like gamejams.
